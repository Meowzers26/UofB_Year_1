0 = false; 1 = true (any non-zero value is interpreted as true)


if (expression) statement;
else if (expression) statement;
else statement;                      // optional else

OR

if (expression) { }                 // block can be used for mult expressions (no semicolon)


procedure can be declared before being defined --> prototyping
    - resolves mutual function calls, makes procedure ordering less of a problem


most local scope takes precedence, shadowing identifier in more global scope


swich tests integer expression against constant value

#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L --> portable cross-platform interface
c is portable but not platform-independent


c does not detect overflow of arrays (referencing seq[3] when there are only 3 elements)


'O' notation:
-- keeps most significant term
-- discards coefficients
    -- an => n => O(n)


1 bit       = 1 binary digit
1 byte      = 8 bits
            = 2 hexadecimal digits
1 nibble    = 4 bits
            = 1 hexadecimal digit (0000 (0) - 1111 (15))
1 short     = 2 bytes
            = 4 hexadecimal digits

*when writing hex literals, prepend 0x

during overflow, byte becomes 0. similarly, underflow will cause byte to become 255.

signed char: can be negative
    -- leftmost bit reserved for sign (0 for positive, 1 for nrgative)
    -- flip every bit of the positive number (binary) then add 1
